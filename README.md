nodebots-ecosystem
==================

## Okay, here's the deal.

This is a monumental project to finish before NodeBots day. So I'm enlisting some help maybe?

If you can grab a platform, and fill out the template in js/template.js for it, then c/p that template into platforms.js, that'd be super.

I'm filing an issue for every platform that I know of, but if I missed one, feel free to create an issue (and maybe PR it!)

I will be working on the functionality around platforms.js. If you really want to help with that, I'll see what I can do.
